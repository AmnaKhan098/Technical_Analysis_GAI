# Generative AI Stock Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a Generative AI-powered application designed to provide real-time stock analysis based on user queries.  
It integrates multiple modules to extract stock symbols, fetch and visualize market data, analyze price trends, and retrieve the latest news related to the queried stock.

## Features
- Automatic ticker symbol extraction from natural language queries  
- Real-time stock chart visualization using the latest market data  
- AI-generated analysis of stock price movements and technical indicators  
- Retrieval of top 5 latest news articles relevant to the company or stock

## Workflow
1. User submits a query (e.g., “What’s happening with Apple stock?”)  
2. The system identifies the relevant stock ticker (e.g., AAPL)  
3. The latest stock chart is displayed for the identified ticker  
4. An AI model analyzes the chart and provides insights  
5. The top 5 recent news articles related to the stock are fetched and shown

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Generative AI (LLMs)  
- Stock market API (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)  
- News API (e.g., NewsAPI.org)  
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly)  
- Streamlit or Flask for web interface

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for historical stock comparison  
- Incorporate social media sentiment analysis  
- Enable voice-based query input  
- Add personalized portfolio tracking and alerts
